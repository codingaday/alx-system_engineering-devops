Whiteboard Design: Three-server distributed web infrastructure for www.foobar.com


Breakdown:
Server 1: Load Balancer running HAProxy

Receives all client requests

Distributes traffic in Round Robin fashion between Server 2 and Server 3

Server 2 & Server 3: Each runs:

Nginx (web server) to handle HTTP requests and static content

Application server (your code base) to process business logic

Database: MySQL in Primary-Replica configuration

Primary handles all writes

Replica handles reads, replicates data asynchronously or semi-sync

Additional notes:
Load Balancer distribution algorithm: Round Robin â€” cycles through servers evenly

Active-Active vs Active-Passive:

Currently Active-Passive since only 1 load balancer exists (no failover load balancer)

Primary vs Replica DB:

Primary handles writes, Replica handles reads

Replica stays slightly behind Primary but improves read scalability

SPOF:

Load balancer (single node)

Database Primary node

Security & monitoring issues:

No HTTPS termination or firewall configured

No monitoring or logging set up
